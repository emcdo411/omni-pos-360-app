## 🚀 Overview

**OmniPOS360** is a full-featured Point of Sale (POS) simulation built in **React Native** using **Expo**, designed to show how modern AI/ML capabilities can power up business operations, sales forecasting, and fraud detection—at the edge and in real time.

It's modular, offline-first, and built for stakeholder storytelling.

- 🛒 Product catalog & cart logic
- 🧾 QR/barcode scanner + mock printer logic
- 📶 Offline-first sync queue
- 📈 Live dashboards with AI-simulated metrics

## 🧠 AI Modules

1. **Sales Forecasting**

   * Based on historical mock data
   * UI toggle to enable/disable
   * Triggers real-time prediction updates

2. **Fraud Detection**

   * Simulated Isolation Forest logic
   * Flags anomalies over a certain threshold

3. **Customer Clustering**

   * K-Means logic on historical sales
   * Groups visualized by behavior types

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React Native + TailwindCSS
* **Backend:** Firebase / Node.js (Simulated APIs)
* **AI Logic:** `prophet`, `isotree`, `kmeans` (simulated with JSON)
* **DevOps:** GitHub Actions + optional Docker

---

## 📊 Business Use Case

📌 **If I were the TPM for a 17-location rollout**, I’d focus on:

* Ensuring sales don’t halt during outages (offline queue)
* Scaling inventory sync via Firebase triggers
* Using AI forecasts to plan staffing and prep
* Monitoring for transaction fraud centrally
* Quickly onboarding employees via role-based UI

💡 Add-on: Custom Notion playbook titled:

> “17-Store AI POS Deployment: Timeline, Risk, and Value Storytelling”
