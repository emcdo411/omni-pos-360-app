## 🧭 For TPMs

> Real-World Questions Answered in the README supplement:

* How does the app handle internet downtime in stores?
* How scalable is this architecture for 17+ locations?
* Where are the failover points in the sync logic?
* How are AI outputs validated in mock pipelines?
* Could the AI modules be externalized via microservices?

Also includes a **Notion PDF** titled:

📌 *"If I Were the TPM Overseeing a 17-Store POS Rollout..."*
